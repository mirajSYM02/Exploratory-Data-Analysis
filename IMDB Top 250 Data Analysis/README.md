## Hightlights of the analysis:


Based on the analysis of the dataset, we can draw the following inferences and conclusions:

1. The majority of movies in the dataset have a rating between 8.0 and 9, indicating that they are generally well-received by audiences.

2. The year 1995 had the most number of top movies in the list, followed by 2004 and 1957.

3. R and PG-13 are the most common certificate ratings in the top 250 list, suggesting that most of the movies are targeted towards mature audiences.

4. Christopher Nolan, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese have the most movies in the top 250 list, while Hayao Miyazaki has the highest among non-English language directors.

5. Longer movies with a duration of 180 minutes are popular among filmmakers, with both classic and modern movies in the list, suggesting that audiences are willing to invest their time in movies that offer a rich and immersive experience.

6. PG-13 is the most common certificate rating for the genre of Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi movies, while R-rated movies are common for the genre of Action, Crime, and Drama movies.

7. Successful and highly acclaimed directors are not limited to a single genre, and versatility and a willingness to experiment with different genres may contribute to a director's success.

8. There is a fluctuation in the average rating of movies over the years, with the highest being in the 1970s and 1990s and the lowest being in the 1920s and 1930s, but there is no significant difference between the average rating of the last decade and the previous decade.
