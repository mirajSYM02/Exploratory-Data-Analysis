## Introduction:
The higher education system is one of the most important drivers of a country's economic growth and development. It is crucial to understand the factors that contribute to student retention in higher education institutions. This analysis aims to explore the Higher Education Predictors of Student Retention dataset, which was obtained from Kaggle, to understand the relationship between various factors and student retention.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The first step in the analysis was to load the dataset into a pandas dataframe and perform initial checks to see if there were any missing values or inconsistencies in the data. After performing data cleaning and preparation, the data was ready for further analysis.

## Data Exploration:
The next step was to explore the data and understand the relationships between the various variables. A summary of the distribution of ages at enrollment was obtained and a histogram was plotted to visualize the distribution.

## Relationship between Gender and Approved Curricular Units:
The distribution of the number of approved curricular units in the first semester was plotted for male and female students. The results showed that the distributions for male and female students were similar, with the majority of students having between 0 and 10 approved curricular units.

## Relationship between Credited Curricular Units and Grades:
The relationship between the number of credited curricular units in the first semester and the grade received in that semester was analyzed using a scatter plot. The results showed a positive correlation between the number of credited curricular units and the grade received in the first semester.

## Relationship between Credited Curricular Units and Evaluations:
The correlation between the number of credited curricular units in the first semester and the number of evaluations in that semester was analyzed using a scatter plot. The results showed a positive correlation between the number of credited curricular units and the number of evaluations in the first semester.

## Effect of Previous Qualification on Credited Curricular Units:
The effect of previous qualification on the number of credited curricular units in the first semester was analyzed by grouping the data by previous qualification and plotting the mean number of credited curricular units for each group. The results showed that students with higher previous qualifications tended to have a higher number of credited curricular units in the first semester.

## Effect of Scholarship Holder Status on Approved Curricular Units:
The effect of scholarship holder status on the number of approved curricular units in the first and second semesters was analyzed by grouping the data by scholarship holder status and plotting the mean number of approved curricular units for each group. The results showed that scholarship holder students tended to have a higher number of approved curricular units in both the first and second semesters.

## Conclusion:
This analysis has provided insights into the relationship between various factors and student retention in higher education institutions. The results showed that there is a positive correlation between the number of credited curricular units and the grade received in the first semester, as well as between the number of credited curricular units and the number of evaluations in that semester. The analysis also showed that previous qualification and scholarship holder status can affect the number of approved curricular units in the first and second semesters.

## Future Work:
In the future, it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis using other relevant datasets to validate the results obtained from this analysis. It would also be interesting to analyze the relationship between other factors, such as nationality and family background, and student retention.
